# DOGEtotheMoon
The URL of the website : [here](https://dogecoinetothemoon.herokuapp.com/)

It's a reference of different tweet where Elon Musk say "DOGE coin to the moon".  
So with this website we can represent the DOGE coin "to the moon" with rotation to the Moon picture. As this way, we can see the percent change of the last 24 hours.   
The higher the percentage change of the last 24 hours, the higher the moon
